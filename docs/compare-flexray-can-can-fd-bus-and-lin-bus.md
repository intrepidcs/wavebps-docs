# Compare FlexRay, CAN / CAN FD bus and LIN Bus

FlexRay, CAN / CAN FD Bus, and LIN bus are very different protocols and fit very different applications. Therefore, it is very unlikely that any of these protocols will replace the other. For example, the FlexRay protocol was designed for specific time deterministic applications with fault tolerance and may replace CAN / CAN FD in applications such as safety, chassis, and powertrain but not in body or diagnostics.
