# Other Buses

Besides CAN / CAN FD, LIN, and FlexRay other buses are used in embedded applications. For vehicle applications, [J1850](j1850) has been a popular protocol for many older vehicles in North America. [I2C](i2c-or-smbus) and [SPI](spi-bus) bus are used internally in ECUs. [UART](uart-k-line-j1708-iso9141-gm-cgi-rs232) based protocols are very popular with implementations such as J1708, Keyword 2000, ISO9141, GM CGI, K-Line, and RS232.
